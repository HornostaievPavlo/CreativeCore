# CreativeCore
This project is a dynamic playground created using assets from the Unity [Creative Core](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/creative-core) learning pathway. Its primary purpose is to serve as a hands-on environment for learning and mastering working with 3D graphics in Unity while building scenes that feature the most realistic lighting possible. This project leverages the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for its graphics rendering.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Visual Effects (VFX):** Learn how to create stunning visual elements that can transform your scenes.

- **Realistic Lighting:** Learn how to achieve the most realistic and immersive lighting scenarios to bring your scenes to life.

- **Animation:** Learn the art of animation and how to make 3D models come alive with dynamic and engaging movements.

- **Audio:** Learn the role of audio in enhancing the overall experience of 3D scenes and how to integrate sound effects and music seamlessly.

- **Shaders:** Learn shaders to create custom visual effects and materials that elevate the realism of objects.

- **User Interface (UI):** Develop creative skills by designing user interfaces that provide a seamless and engaging user experience.

- **And More:** This project is a creative playground, so there are endless opportunities to explore various aspects of game development.
